# Excalidraw without firebase

This is a fork from the [excalidraw project](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) with changes inspired and partly taken from [Kilian Decaderincourt](https://gitlab.com/kiliandeca/excalidraw-fork) to enable support for rooms without using firebase.<br />

## Setup with docker

Please copy the .env.development.default or .env.production.default file to .env (or with environment without default at the end) and change it according to your needs, see [react-scripts](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/).

### Development

```
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec excalidraw yarn install
docker-compose exec excalidraw yarn start
```

Hint: Collab mode requires a secure context (https). Localhost works as well, but not http over local network.

#### Commands

| Command            | Description                       |
